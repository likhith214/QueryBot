I use VScode IDE and the powershell terminal to run the code within VScode

1] Install required packages
open your Python Interpreter then type 
 
"pip install streamlit streamlit-chat langchain transformers googlesearch-python"


as we are working with API need to get api key from the huffingface to use it online 
Step 1: sigh up to 
"https://huggingface.co/join"

Step2: tap on your profile image and select "settings" option then will get so many options on the left select "Access Tokens" 
then tap on "new token" then name anything in name and "Role" as default to "Read" then tap on  "Generate a Token" and copy the token for future purpose.

Then run the script with 

"streamlit run imarticusbot.py"  

check for error if error occurs it must be dependency error install it with "pip install Package name" 
there's no error in code because its running in my machine.

after successfull execution of code it opens the bot tab in your respective default browser in the left paste your token and press enter 

Thats it the imartibot is ready to ROCK

now enter the query in the text box to get the response.
